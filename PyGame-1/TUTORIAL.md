# Nodes, Edges, and Graphics

- All objects are represented using a graph. A graph is a collection of
nodes and edges.
- Every node has three properties to represent location: x, y, and z.
- Every edge has exactly two unique nodes. An edge is used to connect two nodes
together. Edges cannot connect nodes to themselves.
- Edges come together to create a single object, called a Wireframe.
